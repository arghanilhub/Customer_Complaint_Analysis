# Consumer_Complaint_Analysis ( Bank of America )
<br/> 
<h3>Project Background</h3> 
<hr>
Analyzing the consumer complaints on the financial products and services for the bank of america from 2017 to 2023. 

Normally, customers submit their complaints to the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)**, which then forwards them to the bank. However, due to the recent rise in complaints, the bank wants to analyze seven years of complaint data to identify any trends related to specific products receiving the most complaints.  The dataset used for this analysis is real and sourced from the CFPB database.<br/> 

This project throughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights which will help the bank improve services and enhance customer retention.

**Answering the following key questions through my analysis in these areas :** <br/> 

**Complaint trend** : Do consumer complaints show any kind of seasonal pattern?<br/> 
**Product analysis** : For which Product and services, customer's are complaining about most? what are their common issues? and how they are being typically resolved?<br/> 
**Company Responce** : Is there any trend in the company's responses to the problems arising from the products with the most complaints? Can we learn anything from the issues where the company is providing *untimely responses*? 

**Complaint tracker** : In 2023, how many complaint are still *in-progress*?<br/>  
Both the complaint analysis and tracker reports, created in Excel, can be downloaded from the following link: [Download the Excel report](https://github.com/arghanilhub/Customer_Complaint_Analysis/blob/main/Financial_Consumer_Complaints.xlsx)
