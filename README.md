# Consumer_Complaint_Analysis ( Bank of America )
<br/> 
<h3>Project Background</h3> 
<hr>
Analyzing the consumer complaints on the financial products and services for the bank of america from 2017 to 2023. 

Normally, customers submit their complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which then forwards them to the bank. However, due to the recent rise in complaints, the bank wants to analyze seven years of complaint data to identify any trends related to specific products receiving the most complaints. This analysis will help the bank improve services and enhance customer retention. The dataset used for this analysis is real and sourced from the CFPB database.
